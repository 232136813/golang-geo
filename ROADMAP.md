# golang-geo roadmap

## [1.0.0] Desired Featureset

  - **Cleaner top-level namespace** It seems rather messy to have the entire impelentation of golang-geo to be in the same root-level directory.  It seems like it would be better if users could import "github.com/kellydunn/golang-geo/sql" for sql funcitonality.
  - **Extract geocoder implementations into seperate libraries** In the future, golang-geo's responsibilities will not be to 
  - **Rename API methods to be the exact name of the corresponding mathematical functions** The current implementation hides domain knowledge by convoluting the name of the API methods and what they actually do.
  - **All point logic should be at the `geo` namespace level and not struct methods of points** It feels rather awkward to calculate haversine distances by issuing a struct-level method.
